# Preface

Welcome to the Rust for Bitcoiners course.
This course expects that you have programming experience in languages like C, C++, Java, Python, Js etc.,
Here I will try to justify the reasons behind the design of Rust programming language itself,
with exhaustive but simple examples.

## Goal of completing this course

* Ability to read the documentations of Rust code effectively.
* Search the internet for Rust related queries effectively.
* Write effective Rust code.
* Understand why Rust is important for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Assignments are based on Bitcoin related concepts to kindle your enthusiasm.

In essence, Rust requires you to be more explicit and reason more carefully about memory management as
you write. While this may feel like unnecessary overhead coming from another language such as Python or
JavaScript, you will soon see that it comes with many benefits that pay off in the long term, in
performance, readability and safety. Once you get the hang of a few key aspects of this language, you
might even find it difficult to go back!

## Getting started with Rust

Visual Studio code with Rust extensions enabled is the most commonly used setup and easier
for beginners as well.
