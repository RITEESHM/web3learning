# Summary

* In this module we saw how to organize functions associated with a type using `impl`
* Defining and implementing Traits
* Intuition for one way functions which are used for hashing and encryption

For the upcoming assignment read Chapter 11 of William Stallings - Cryptography and Network Security_ Principles and Practice, Global Edition-Pearson (2022) book.
You will be required to come up with your own version of a "secure" one way hashing algorithm similar
to SHA-256.
