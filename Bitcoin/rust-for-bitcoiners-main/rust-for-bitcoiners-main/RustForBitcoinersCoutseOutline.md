# Rust for Bitcoiners: Project-Oriented Course Outline

## Module 1: Rust Basics through Cryptography
### Project 1: Implementing a Caesar Cipher in Rust
- **Objective:** Learn the basics of Rust by creating a Caesar cipher, focusing on Rust syntax, strings, and basic control flow.
- **Topics Covered:** Rust setup, mutable vs. immutable variables, functions, user input, and command-line arguments.

## Module 2: Structs, Enums, and Error Handling with a Cryptocurrency Ledger
### Project 2: Simple Cryptocurrency Ledger System
- **Objective:** Dive into Rust's structs, enums, and error handling by developing a ledger system to record transactions of a simple cryptocurrency.
- **Topics Covered:** Structs, enums, match statements, vectors, file I/O, and comprehensive error handling, difference between Option and Result.

## Module 3: Data Handling and Serialization in Rust
### Project 3: Serializing and Deserializing Bitcoin Transactions
- **Objective:** Understand Rust's capabilities for data serialization and deserialization using Bitcoin transactions as a case study.
- **Topics Covered:** Use of external crates, JSON and binary serialization, working with Bitcoin transaction data structures, intro to Box and Trait objects.

## Module 4: Multithreading and Networking
### Project 4: Multithreaded Bitcoin Node Connector
- **Objective:** Build a tool to connect to a Bitcoin node using multithreading, focusing on networking and concurrency in Rust.
- **Topics Covered:** Thorough discussion on allocators and basic Networking, threads, TCP connections,shared state using Arc and Mutex.

## Module 5: Advanced Rust Features for Cryptographic Applications
### Project 5: Building a Basic Cryptographic Library
- **Objective:** Demonstrate the power of Rust Generics by building a library using Generics
to simplify the code, this would help the students to read the Rust documentation better.
- **Topics Covered:** Generics, traits, lifetime specifiers.


Then the current chaincode projects can be done.
Later we conjure up some ideas using async and other advanced libraries in Rust.

I have made these projects in a simplistic manner so that students can focus on learning
Rust properly at the same time being enthusiastic about bitcoin and cryptography.
