Brave is a new and rapidly growing web browser. What makes the Brave browser different is that it gives its users the option to view ads. (Or not.) And should you choose to view them, you'll be rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT). At today's value, they're not worth much, but hey, it's better than Facebook getting that money, eh?
Despite Brave gaining widespread traction, BAT's price movement has been lackluster to date (compared to other heavy gainers, of course!). But that hasn't stopped Brave from releasing a newly integrated crypto wallet into its browser (awesome). And we do believe 2022 could be the year Brave really catches fire and takes off.
